      <description>Hi there 👋 I never really thought I&#39;d be one to write and talk about myself. I&#39;ve always had a habit of locking away my thoughts and processing them over and over until I get distracted by something else to think about. So, this blog is really another form of expression about the topics I often analyse (or over-analyse) in my day-to-day work and personal life.
As you probably know, after I left University all those years ago, I began a career in Software Engineering.</description>
