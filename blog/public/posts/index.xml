      <description>How I became a Lead Engineer When people ask me how I became a Lead, I often give them the short story of &amp;ldquo;I&#39;m not so sure myself&amp;rdquo;, then be a little modest, rambling how it wasn&#39;t 100% in my hands. But only recently I&#39;ve noticed that there are other engineers aspiring to lead one day, and it&#39;s only fair to give a thorough explanation to how and why it happened.</description>

      <description>Mental Health and Fitness Growing up as an only child, I was spoilt compared to the other kids at my school. I didn&#39;t have to share any of my belongings at home, and I could play with them until I got told off to go to bed.
It was so easy at that age to slip into isolation and just play all by myself. I was a bit of a chubby kid, I enjoyed sports when I was at school and tried joining different football teams but never really kept up the momentum.</description>

      <description>Hi there 👋 I never really thought I&#39;d be one to write and talk about myself. I&#39;ve always had a habit of locking away my thoughts and processing them over and over until I get distracted by something else to think about. So, this blog is really another form of expression about the topics I often analyse (or over-analyse) in my day-to-day work and personal life.
As you probably know, after I left University all those years ago, I began a career in Software Engineering.</description>
