<p>My journey of computer code stems back to my teenage years, just after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">Dot-com bubble</a>. There were a lot of web development platforms around like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">Yahoo! GeoCities</a>, that were relatively regulated but you could pretty much build what you wanted. I remember building quite a weirdly gothic themed website, with inconsistent navigation, absolutely no USP and a brilliant collection of stolen gifs. Irregardless of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo">Emo Subculture</a> that may of had a hand in the design choice, there was so much satisfaction building and owning a project that you delivered by yourself entirely. I was the Engineer and CEO, my choices and decisions were correct and no one could question it. If you're a particular nostalgic reader, I'm afraid I was too naive realise how important Source Control was and lost the code many years ago.</p>
<p>After that experience, I continued to develop my skills in IT. A lot of it in my school years and A levels were mainly reporting and collaborating with others. There were small web development tasks that mainly involved &ldquo;copy this code and see it work&rdquo;, and unfortunately then we didn't have Stack Overflow. But when I hit University, that's when it all changed (and we had Stack Overflow). It took me a lot of time to get my head around what was actually happening. I remember reading print outs of code snippets, annotating them to understand what every single term meant (I mean the return type <strong>void</strong>? What's wrong with using the term nothing?). I found learning software engineering was a lot of sporadic eureka moments, when my brain just clicked with no warning. It was pretty satisfying when you could finally grasp the basics and start your own mini project without any supervision.</p>
<p>But you're probably asking why this is important? Well actually it is
When we get put into a mentoring or leadership type of role, we don't actually get any preparation before on how we're supposed to do it. I was very experienced in listening to others and being told what to do. But being on the other side of the table, you really felt a bit hopeless at times when you didn't have answers to your teammates questions, especially if you're in a management position. The good news is a lot of companies these days realise that some people just don't want to do line management. They offer a completely separate career path where you can specialise in what you're good at, and not make sacrifices to your technical responsibilities. We're essentially educated to do the job and just hope we're a good fit to the first company we apply for.</p>
<p>So how do you get into a leadership role?
Unfortunately it won't be an immediate process. You can't simply be the engineer then the manager after a few years under your belt, it's all about the drive and mentality of the individual and what motivates them. The great thing about management is you get to see how others grow, and it really opens your eyes to how unique every person is, based on their personality, motivators and skill sets. Another mistake a lot of people do is jump into the role way too early. If you're really itching to get that next leadership role, it's important to remember that you'll never know the whole story until you actually do it. You have to prepare yourself for uncertainty. Having conversations with leaders (that includes your line manager), really helps give you informative insight into what they day-to-day activities are.</p>
<p>To land into the role though, you need to already be doing it</p>
<p>How do I already do a role that I don't have?
I've seen previously, some people fall into the trap of doing simply what they're contracted to do. The classic, &ldquo;This is not my problem&rdquo;. Contractual role agreement and responsibilities help for a lot of ambiguous situations, understanding who should responsible for what. But we're all human and unfortunately there'll never be a perfect organisation structure diagram (Google even gave up drawing them years ago). To be a leader, you need to lead. Changing your job title will not solve any problems, if anything it can make it worse when it's given to the wrong person. When we aspire to a more senior role, we often see filter out of all the real-world day-to-day troubles and focus on what looks exciting. A good leader would already taking charge irrespective of their job title and facing into those challenging situations.</p>
<p>Share evidence with you line manager
It's important to remember that you don't want try and be in your manager's face all the time. It's not natural and too obvious for others to think you're out for yourself. Share your experiences with your line manager on a agreed time, usually in your one-to-one's or even in casual chat if the topic arises. If you're rather new in your career, it's easy to have high expectations of your line manager. You think they should have answers to <em>everything</em> but actually you'll find there in a much more similar position to you than you think. You will have moments where you think you deserve some form of praise or reward but your manager may not see it that way or question to why you deserve it. The key point is to always ask for feedback. Be aware of your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence">emotional intelligence</a>, a good leader is someone who can react with a constructive response.  You're not the only one who is achieving and reaching for their next step up in their career.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sara Model Img</p>
<p>That's a lot of stuff I shouldn't do, so what should I do?
Keep learning. You don't reach an end point in your career and expect to know everything. Experience will make you more prepared but ultimately the challenges will keep on coming. You need to be honest with yourself and transparent on your actions.</p>
