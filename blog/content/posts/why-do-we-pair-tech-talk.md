description = "I did a tech talk at Sainsbury's in late 2019. I give a very brief personal story of how pairing can be effective in almost any environment. If you're interested to learn more of why pair programming can be effective, check out the whole video in this post!"

The project I'm currently assigned to encourages pair programming as an engineering principal. In this talk, you'll hear story about me and my partner doing the classic weekend chores together. I trialled a brief experiment to see how efficient we could be by mixing up ownership and responsibilities of each task.

At the end of this talk, you'll hear from questions from the [Sainsbury's Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/sainsburysdtd/) division asking more about the [SmartShop](https://smartshop.sainsburys.co.uk/) project I'm working on and hopefully deeper insight in how we function as a team.
