## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I never really thought I'd be one to write and talk about myself. I've always had a habit of locking away my
thoughts and processing them over and over until I get distracted by something else to think about. So this blog is
really another form of expression about the topics I often analyse (or over-analyse) in my day-to-day work and
personal life.

As you probably know, after I left University all those years ago, I began a career in Software Engineering. Starting
my first job as a Junior Developer was **hard**, I loved the attempt at hacking away and actually building something
for another person to use. But quite quickly, things went wrong. So many moments where I scratched by head and just
said "I have absolutely no idea what is happening?". My evenings consisted of using a variety of learning resources
just to understand what the hell [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) meant, 
regardless how many times my lecturer told me.

As I continued to make more and more mistakes with the companies code base, I learnt a substantial amount of my own
potential and starting to think bigger on what I wanted to do with my career. I joined a bigger company, where the
working environment completely changed.
