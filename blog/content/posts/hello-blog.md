## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I never really thought I'd be one to write and talk about myself. I've always had a habit of locking away my
thoughts and processing them over and over until I get distracted by something else to think about. So, this blog is
really another form of expression about the topics I often analyse (or over-analyse) in my day-to-day work and
personal life.

As you probably know, after I left University all those years ago, I began a career in Software Engineering. Starting my first job as a Junior Developer was **hard**, I loved the attempt at hacking away and actually building something for another person to use. But quite quickly, things went wrong. So many moments where I scratched by head and just said "I have absolutely no idea what is happening?". My evenings consisted of using a variety of learning resources just to understand what the hell [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) meant, regardless how many times my lecturer told me.

As I continued to make more and more mistakes with the companies code base, I learnt a substantial amount of my own
potential and starting to think bigger on what I wanted to do with my career. I joined a bigger company, where the
working environment completely changed. Mistakes had bigger consequences and I couldn't hack to my heartâ€™s content without collaborating with others.

This point in time I think is where my passion for my career really began. Sure, it was fun being a contributor and improving a large-scale system, but what really grasped me is the psychology of people. Just like figuring out a bug in code, my brain clicked. I realised there was an avenue to learn and understand others in such a way, that regardless of their technical knowledge, they could still succeed in a difficult environment. I started reading books on how teams collaborated in software and focused on how to see signals of a healthy team. Then something pretty spectacular happened...

#### I got made a Manager!

And a few years later, here I am still looking over a team to succeed at their best. 

In my following posts, I've got a variety of stories to tell in and outside of work, ranging from technical
discussions to interpersonal stories with other humans. 

### Thanks for reading! ðŸ˜Š
