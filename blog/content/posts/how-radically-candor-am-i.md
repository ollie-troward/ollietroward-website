description = "I ran an experiment for 4 weeks to visualise how candid I am with my colleagues at the workplace. Using the 4 quadrant matrix taken from the Radical Candor book authored by Kim Scott, it opened my eyes to how effective I am when giving feedback to my colleagues. I had to be quite honest with myself and there were obvious times where I clearly didn't succeed. Some of them arguably could be down to just my mood and perception on those days and I was just flat out wrong entirely. All names are removed for my colleagues privacy."

## How 'Radically Candor' am I?
To be an effective manager you need to have the difficult conversations. Radical Candor is a framework that teaches you on how to give feedback effectively, to ensure that you're doing everything you can to support your team and let them become their best. When starting out in management, it's easy to let problems slide and just be nice. A lot of people were brought up in a world where they were told "if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all". We all know that the world doesn't run on just being nice, all of us really learn when something goes wrong. But unfortunately sometimes we don't realise when something does go wrong. That's where your boss comes in. 

> _How many times have you been in scenario's where you found out you made a mistake and no one told you?_

You can feel almost robbed that no one told you about that mistake. It damages the trust and relationship of your peers and more importantly your boss. You can feel ignored and mislead, and worst case look to other places where people will care about how you're doing at job. But on the flip side of this, humans have emotionally charged ups and downs on a daily basis. We don't want to be told every day that we suck, we want some respect and awareness that we are doing a good job. So, how do we get this right? Let's look a bit deeper into the Radical Candor framework.

### Quadrant #1 - Manipulative Insincerity
Let's start with the worst of the worst. 

{{< image src="/img/gossiping.jpg" alt="Gossiping behind co-workers back" position="center">}}

Isn't it just so easy to get sucked into office gossip about someone else's misfortunes? We're all human, ultimately it makes use feel better about ourselves, as sad it may come across. But as a boss, you need to avoid it at all costs. Your direct reports are trusting you with their personal issues, in and outside the office. If you can't keep discussions in confidence, then being a boss isn't for you. Radical Candor describes a brilliant example of the classic, â€˜seeing someone forgetting to do their flies upâ€™. If you act in this quadrant, you're doing the individual an incredible disservice of pure embarrassment. What happens if you don't tell them? Well more people would clearly pick up on it and just drag on the embarrassment more. What's worse is you would go behind their back and tell others about it. 

What I love about this example is it created a ðŸ’¡ moment for me. It can be related to so many different scenarios. We are confusing beings at times, because a lot of more introverted people like myself would not want to deal with the shear awkwardness of having a conversation about the person's flies. I find public transport is another great example in the UK like the London Tube, where people may drop something or have something on their face. You'll get a mixture of some people offering their help or pointing it out, and others not wanting to engage at all and expect the person to figure it out themselves.

### Quadrant #2 - Ruinous Empathy
This quadrant actually ranks at #3. It's an improvement because you're actually engaging the person rather than talking behind that backs. But this is the quadrant I think we all fall into from time-to-time.

{{< image src="/img/praise-ruinous-empathy.png" alt="The Reassurer" position="center">}}

There's nothing worse than someone telling you that everything is going to be alright and is always on your side. We do this a lot more with closer family and friends, because we want to always be on their side and provide unconditional reassurance. However, it's quite different in the workplace. It's healthy to challenge one another, diversity and difference will ultimately give you a better result in the long run, compared to a team that choose not to debate or engage. 

Ruinous Empathy is so dangerous and sometimes incredibly annoying. You feel like you're not being listened to and your boss is simply trying to keep you happy. It doesn't show that you care about what the individual has to say. Manager's often take actions in one-to-one's and can pose the risk of just not delivering on them. All talk and no action. It's frustrating to work in that sort of environment. You need to build a rapport with your boss and/or direct reports, and create an environment that is safe to challenge. Of course you're showing you care about the individual and trying to be on their side but if you really cared, you would do more to understand of what they're actually saying to you. 


There's a great TED Talk called ["5 Ways to Listen better"](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_5_ways_to_listen_better). What I love about it is it discusses deeper listening, rather than just the words you hear from them.

### Quadrant #3 - Obnoxious Aggression
So this actually ranks as #2, which may come of a surprise to some. Especially leaders who feel a little more introverted.

{{< image src="/img/criticism_obnoxiousaggression.png" alt="The Reassurer" position="center">}}

Let's look back at the unzipped flies scenario, if you saw the individual walk by, shouting out that your flies are down would be embarrassing for them, and some other colleagues nearby may hear about it also. But, ultimately there's less risk of embarrassment, because the problem got resolved sooner. Of course there is still embarrassment, however the person will eventually appreciate the heads up. 

> So we just challenge every mistake?

Well, yes but we all know that isn't easy to solve. Earlier I was mentioning about the concept of rapport with your direct reports and there's often a trend where if your relationship is stronger, challenges will become easier to mention. The graph is a very basic example of what that can look like. It's important to remember that people change quickly and you'll always need to be aware when you feel it's a good time to challenge someone on their work.

### Quadrant #4 - Radical Candor
The best of the best. Jumping back to the flies scenario, we pretty much got there with the obnoxious aggression quadrant. But we did we really need to add to the embarrassment by publicly announcing it? 

{{< image src="/img/radical-candor.jpg" alt="Radical Candor" position="center">}}

Well as you probably guessed, we don't. If you honestly cared about the person who forgot to zip their flies, you'll save them the embarrassment from letting other people know. Imagine if you were the lucky soul who only actually noticed it. You could simply take them aside and tell them before it gets any worse.

> That is being 'Radical Candor'.

You're breaking those awkward barriers to talk about someone's flies and letting them know about it before it could get worse. This is the secret to giving effective feedback, as simple as that example may sound. Obviously it can be more complicated when you're not 100% certain that a individual didn't perform at their best, but it's important to prompt those sort of conversations where possible. Quadrant #3 is actually second best and not the worst. A lot of people (especially in office environments) are afraid of the embarrassment that others will know about their mistakes but it's a lot better than not knowing at all. 

A lot of teams fail to perform on the basis that simply do not communicate. It's not rocket science and even the better performing teams that do, can still leave a lot unsaid. This is usually where the role of the boss, manager or leader needs to step in. You need to pick up on the content that does get left unsaid and understand deeper to why. If your teammates don't feel they trust each other enough or even trust you as a boss, you need earn that trust as much as any one else. You can't force it, but you can create a better self-awareness as a starting point. 

Radical Candor offers options such as prompting the question (as a boss) to ask for feedback themselves. Rather than asking your direct report in every one-to-one, "How are you doing?", ask them "How am I doing? Am I being an effective boss?". A lot of senior leaders pride themselves on they get everything right and never making mistakes. It's obvious people will see through that in a very short amount of time. Every one makes mistakes and you will very quickly lose the human element of your role. 

There's also a great read called "Lead Like Mary", which reveals a concept of servant-leadership, it proposes the idea of flipping your organisation hierarchy upside down. The CEO / Senior Leadership is near the bottom, the Software Engineer's are at the top. 

> The people actually doing work, are the ones running the business. 

When I first really understood that, it made me realise what's actually expected of me as a manager. I wasn't there to dictate or take them down the path I did in my engineering days but actually help them craft their own. Empower them to make decisions for themselves, even if you don't feel 100% in agreement with it.
